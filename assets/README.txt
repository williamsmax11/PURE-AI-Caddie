Assets Folder - Image Requirements

This folder should contain the following images for your Expo app:

1. icon.png (1024x1024px)
   - App icon that appears on the home screen
   - Should be a golf-themed icon (suggested: golf flag, golf ball, or tee)

2. splash.png (1284x2778px for iPhone)
   - Splash screen shown when app launches
   - Should use brand colors (green theme for golf)

3. adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024px, Android only)
   - Foreground layer for Android adaptive icon
   - Should be similar to icon.png but with transparency

4. favicon.png (48x48px)
   - Web browser favicon

For now, Expo will use default placeholders. You can create these images later using:
- Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators like DALL-E or Midjourney

The app will work without these images - they're just for branding.
